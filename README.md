# Olympic
A program that adds an Olympic city to an Olympic country.
A city can only be an Olympic city if it is located in an Olympic country. If the city tries to be declared Olympic, but it is not in the Olympic country, a dialogue (Error type Alert) with the message "Country xxx is not an Olympic country" should be thrown. Also, the setOlympicCountryException method of the City class should in that case throw an exception of type NotOlympicCountryException with the same text.
